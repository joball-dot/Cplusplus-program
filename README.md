# Cplusplus-program
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was the second project of the term with the goal being to create a program that got investment data from a user and displayed how that investment would grow over a user defined period and at a user defined percentage rate. The app was also designed in a way where it could show how interest might accumulate with only an initial investment or with the inital investment and additional monthly investments. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I felt that my program stuck to Object orientated programing very well and that I used my functions very well. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I feel like I could have enhanced my code by placing my functions in a class allowing the main to only need to call on that class instead of each of the individual functions. This would make working on the code down the road even more efficient and secure as they would be better seperated allowing for better additions and changes. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found at the time that making each of the functions especially with the FOR loops was challenging and I managed to overcome this by repeatedly scouring my text book and resources such as gitHub forms for tips for beginners such as myself. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills I gained working on the functions will prove to be invaluable in other course work and in future professional settings as I will continue to use and need them. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following object orriented coding structures, sticking to my psuedo code, and using inline comments to help anyone who looks at the code understand my thought process.
